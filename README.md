# human-pyramid
Kenneth Mckrola

What this program does: The user constructs a human pyramid by entering a number of rows that the pyramid is to contain. Assuming that each person weighs 200 lbs., the output shows the total amount of weight resting on their shoulders from previous rows. At the end of the program, the total runtime is given, designed to show the user the exponential increase in time as the # of rows increases.

What I learned: Algorithmic thinking in terms of overall problem solving and run-time efficiency, recursive calculations and how to cache previous recursions.
